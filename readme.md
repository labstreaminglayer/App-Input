# Overview

This program should work out of the box on Windows 2000 or later. The program grabs all keystrokes and releases done at a computer to allow for recording keyboard events for example while closed-source stimulus presentation software is running. Note that no passwords or personal information should be entered while this program is running. Also keep in mind that this program must run on the stimulus presentation PC.

# Usage

  * Start the Keyboard app. You should see a window like the following.

  * Click the "Link" button to link the app to the lab network. If successful, the button should turn into "Unlink". If a firewall complains, allow the app to connect to the network.

  * You should now have a stream on your lab network that has name "Keyboard" and type "Markers". Note that you cannot close the app while it is linked. The stream contains a single channel of irregular sampling rate with string-formatted values.
